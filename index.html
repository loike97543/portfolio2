        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I’m a Web Developer and Curious Mind 🌐🚀
Born and Raised in West Hempstead, New York.

From the leafy streets of West Hempstead to the digital highways of the web, my journey has been one fueled by curiosity and a relentless desire to understand how things tick.

The Early Days of Wonder
As a kid, I’d sit cross-legged in front of our old desktop computer, mesmerized by the glowing screen. The whir of the hard drive, the clickety-clack of the keyboard—it was magic. I’d tinker with settings, break things (and occasionally fix them), and dive headfirst into the labyrinth of ones and zeros.

The Web Beckons
Fast-forward to today, and I’m a web developer—a modern-day sorcerer weaving HTML, CSS, and JavaScript spells. I build bridges between pixels, transforming ideas into interactive experiences. Whether it’s crafting elegant code or wrestling with responsive layouts, I’m in my element.

Making Things Work
My mission? To make things work seamlessly. From sleek websites that dance gracefully on any screen to dynamic web apps that respond to a user’s every whim, I’m here to turn digital dreams into reality.</p>
